# Chapter 3: Phenomena of Muscle Contraction

A single fiber is all-or-none, yet you can lift a pen or a suitcase with
the same biceps, and hold either one still or move it. This chapter
explains how. It covers the three factors that set the strength of
contraction, the "phenomena" you will record on the kymograph and in
PhysioEx (twitch, treppe, summation, tetanus and fatigue), and the two
basic types of contraction, isotonic and isometric.

It follows the "Fenomena Kontraksi & Refleks Otot" session; the reflex
half of that session is in Chapter 4.

## Three factors that set contraction strength

The force a whole muscle develops depends mainly on:

1. **The degree of stretch** of the muscle before it contracts (the
   length–tension relationship).
2. **The number of motor units** activated (recruitment).
3. **The frequency of stimulation** (summation and tetanus).

Other factors matter too, such as fiber diameter (thicker, hypertrophied
fibers have more myofibrils), fiber type, temperature and fatigue, but
these three are the ones tested in the practicum.

### 1. Degree of stretch: the length–tension relationship

How hard a sarcomere can pull depends on how many crossbridges can form,
and that depends on how much the thick and thin filaments overlap
*before* contraction starts. The force a muscle develops is therefore a
reflection of its starting length, and it is **maximal when the muscle
starts at an optimal length**.

The classic single-sarcomere experiment (Gordon, Huxley and Julian, in the 1960s)
gives four landmark points:

| Point | Sarcomere length | Filament arrangement | Active tension |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **D** (overstretched) | ≈3.6 µm or more | Thin filaments pulled completely out of the A band; no overlap | **Zero** |
| **C** (upper end of plateau) | ≈2.2 µm | Every myosin head can reach actin | **100%** |
| **B** (lower end of plateau) | ≈2.0 µm | Thin filaments just meet in the middle | **100%** |
| **A** (shortened) | Below ≈1.6–2.0 µm | Thin filaments overlap each other and thick filaments butt against the Z discs | **Falls steeply** |

**Optimal condition: sarcomere length 2.0–2.2 µm.** In the body, the
attachment of muscles to bones keeps most skeletal muscles working near
this range, roughly 70% to 130% of optimal length.

At the whole-muscle level there are two components of tension:

- **Active tension** comes from crossbridge cycling and follows the
  overlap curve: highest at the optimal length and lower when the muscle
  is shorter or longer.
- **Passive tension** comes from the elastic recoil of stretched titin
  and connective tissue. It is zero at or below resting length and rises
  steeply as the muscle is stretched further, just as a rubber band
  resists more the more you pull it.
- **Total tension = active + passive.**

  <figcaption>Active tension is greatest at the optimal length (sarcomeres about 2.0–2.2 µm). Stretched further, fewer crossbridges can form, but passive tension from titin and connective tissue climbs. Total tension is the sum of the two.</figcaption>
</figure>

This relationship has everyday consequences. A long jumper crouches
slightly before take-off, bringing the leg muscles close to their
optimal length. In the heart, the same principle (more filling →
more stretch → stronger contraction) is the Frank–Starling law you will
meet in the cardiovascular block.

### 2. Number of motor units recruited

A **motor unit** is **one motor neuron plus all the skeletal muscle
fibers it innervates**. It is the basic functional unit of contraction
from the nervous system's point of view: when the neuron fires, every
fiber in its unit contracts together.

<figure class="diagram slide-figure">
  <img src="/ebook-figures/physiology/chapter-03-fen-9-0.578_0.29_0.868_0.879.webp" alt="Three motor units in one muscle" loading="lazy" width="580" height="663" />
  <figcaption>Three motor units in one muscle: each motor neuron supplies its own scattered group of fibers. <span class="figure-source">Slide 9, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

> **Note on the slides.** The slide defines a motor unit as one motor
> neuron and "the myofibrils it innervates". A neuron innervates whole
> muscle **fibers** (cells), not myofibrils, which are structures inside
> a fiber.

Key facts:

- Each muscle contains many motor units, and the fibers of one unit are
  scattered among fibers of other units rather than clumped together.
- Motor units vary in size. Muscles for fine control have **small units**
  (an extraocular muscle may have about 10–20 fibers per neuron); large
  postural and power muscles have **large units** (the gastrocnemius has
  over a thousand fibers per neuron).
- **The strength of contraction depends on how many motor units are
  active.** Adding units is called **recruitment**, and it is the main
  way force is graded. The session put it simply: *the more motor units,
  the stronger the contraction, and vice versa.*
- Units are recruited in order of size (**Henneman's size principle**):
  small, fatigue-resistant units are activated first for light tasks,
  and large, powerful, fast-fatiguing units are added only when more
  force is needed.
- During sustained contraction, the nervous system rotates activity
  among units (**asynchronous recruitment**), letting some rest while
  others work. This delays fatigue.

In the practicum, raising the stimulus **voltage** mimics recruitment.
A weak stimulus reaches threshold in only a few fibers; a stronger one
excites more, until every fiber responds (the **maximal stimulus**).
Beyond that, raising the voltage adds nothing (see Chapter 5).

### 3. Frequency of stimulation

**Stimulating a muscle repeatedly can increase its force of
contraction.** The key is timing. A muscle action potential lasts only
1–2 ms and the refractory period is equally short, but the twitch it
triggers lasts 10 to more than 100 ms. So a second action potential can
arrive while the fiber is still contracting from the first. More Ca²⁺ is
released before the previous Ca²⁺ has been pumped away, more
crossbridges stay attached, and the tension builds on itself.

</figure>

Frequency and recruitment work together: to lift a heavier weight, the
nervous system both recruits more motor units and makes each fire faster.

## The muscle twitch

A **twitch** is the response to a **single stimulus**: one quick cycle
of contraction and relaxation. It can be produced by a sudden electrical
excitation of the nerve supplying a muscle, or by a brief electrical
stimulus applied to the muscle itself. The result is a sudden
contraction that lasts a fraction of a second.

</figure>

A twitch recorded on a myogram has three phases:

1. **Latent period.** The few milliseconds between the stimulus and the
   start of tension. The fiber looks inactive, but a lot is happening
   inside: the action potential spreads, Ca²⁺ is released from the SR,
   and crossbridges begin to attach and take up the slack in the elastic
   elements.
2. **Contraction phase.** From the start of tension to peak tension,
   while crossbridges are cycling.
3. **Relaxation phase.** From peak tension back to zero, as Ca²⁺ is
   pumped back into the SR. It is usually longer than the contraction
   phase.

  <figcaption>One stimulus (triangle) gives one action potential and one twitch. The action potential is over long before tension peaks, which is why a second stimulus can arrive while the fiber is still contracting.</figcaption>
</figure>

Twitch duration varies with fiber type: about 10 ms for the fast fibers
of the extraocular muscles, and 100 ms or more for slow postural fibers
such as those of the soleus. When stimuli are spaced far enough apart
for complete relaxation, each stimulus gives an identical, separate
twitch.

## Treppe: the staircase effect

**Treppe** (German for "staircase") is a **progressive increase in the
strength of contraction** when a muscle is stimulated **repeatedly, at
short intervals, with the same stimulus intensity, but with each
stimulus arriving only after the muscle has completely relaxed**. The
first few twitches each rise a little higher than the one before, then
they level off. It was first described in heart muscle by Bowditch, so
it is also called the **staircase effect of Bowditch**.

<figure class="diagram slide-figure">
  <img src="/ebook-figures/physiology/chapter-03-fen-16-0.48_0.364_0.93_0.773.webp" alt="Treppe" loading="lazy" width="900" height="461" />
  <figcaption>Treppe: repeated stimuli at 0.5 s intervals produce progressively stronger twitches until they level off. <span class="figure-source">Slide 16, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

The explanation usually given is that the muscle "warms up":

- Ca²⁺ is not completely cleared between twitches, so each stimulus
  releases Ca²⁺ onto a slightly higher starting level, and more troponin
  sites are occupied;
- the heat of contraction raises muscle temperature, speeding up
  enzymes, including myosin ATPase;
- the elastic elements are already slightly stretched.

Treppe is why athletes warm up before competition.

## Summation

**Summation** (*sumasi*, also called **wave summation** or temporal
summation) is the appearance of a **new contraction before the previous
one has ended**. Part of the second contraction is added on top of the
first, so the total tension rises. As the frequency increases, the
summed tension keeps climbing.

Treppe and summation are easy to confuse:

| | Treppe | Summation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When the next stimulus arrives | After **complete** relaxation | **Before** relaxation is complete |
| What the record looks like | Separate twitches, each slightly taller | Twitches merge; each peak rides on the last |
| Why tension increases | Warm-up effects (Ca²⁺, temperature) | Ca²⁺ builds up before it can be removed; crossbridges stay attached |

## Tetanus: unfused and fused

If the frequency of stimulation keeps increasing, summation turns into
**tetanus**, a sustained contraction.

  <figcaption>Single twitches, summation, unfused tetanus, and complete tetanus followed by fatigue. <span class="figure-source">Slide 22, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

- **Incomplete (unfused) tetanus.** The stimuli come fast enough that
  the muscle cannot fully relax, but slowly enough that it relaxes
  **partially** between them. The record rises to a wavy plateau.
  **Valleys (dips) between the peaks** show that there is still a short
  gap between stimuli.
- **Complete (fused) tetanus.** The stimuli come so fast that **no
  relaxation at all** is possible between them. The peaks and valleys
  merge into a **smooth, straight line** at the maximum tension the
  muscle can develop. There are no valleys, because stimulation is
  continuous with no gap. The tension of a complete tetanus is typically
  three to four times that of a single twitch.
- **Maximal tetanic tension** is reached when a further increase in
  frequency no longer increases the tension.

> **Note on the slides.** One slide in the practicum deck swaps the
> definitions, describing *fused* tetanus as stimulation "before the wave
> reaches relaxation" and *unfused* tetanus as the one where "peaks and
> valleys merge into a straight line". The correct pairing is the one
> above: **unfused = partial relaxation, wavy; fused = no relaxation,
> smooth.**

Normal voluntary movements are brief, smooth tetanic contractions. The
smoothness comes from asynchronous firing of many motor units; any single
unit is usually in unfused tetanus.

## Fatigue

**Fatigue** (*kelelahan*) is **a decline in the force a muscle can
produce even though it is still being stimulated**. On a record of fused
tetanus, fatigue appears as the plateau sagging and then falling toward
zero despite continuing stimuli. The capacity for work declines roughly
in step with **the depletion of muscle glycogen**.

  <figcaption>Where fatigue may arise, from the CNS to the contractile proteins, and the mechanisms proposed at each site. <span class="figure-source">Slide 21, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

Fatigue is divided by where it arises:

| Type | Site | Proposed mechanisms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Central fatigue** | Brain and spinal cord | Psychological factors (loss of motivation, discomfort) and protective reflexes that reduce motor drive before the muscle is damaged |
| **Peripheral fatigue** | Neuromuscular junction | Less neurotransmitter (ACh) released; reduced receptor activation |
| | Excitation–contraction coupling | Changes in the muscle membrane potential (for example K⁺ building up in the T-tubules) |
| | Ca²⁺ signal | Ca²⁺ leaking from the SR; less Ca²⁺ released; weaker Ca²⁺–troponin binding |
| | Contraction–relaxation | **Depletion** of creatine phosphate, ATP and glycogen; **accumulation** of H⁺, inorganic phosphate (Pi) and lactate |

Two points are worth remembering:

- Lactic acid used to be blamed for fatigue. Current evidence suggests
  **lactate itself is not a major cause**. Accumulation of **inorganic
  phosphate** (which impairs Ca²⁺ release and crossbridge force) and
  **Ca²⁺ leak from the SR** are more likely culprits.
- Fatigue is protective. It stops a muscle before its ATP falls so low
  that crossbridges lock into rigor. ATP levels in a fatigued muscle
  actually stay surprisingly close to normal.

In the practicum, fatigue follows complete tetanus. It is attributed to
accumulated lactic acid, ADP and Pi after high-intensity activity, and
the tension recovers partially after a rest.

## Isotonic and isometric contraction

Muscle contractions are classified by what happens to length and
tension:

<figure class="diagram slide-figure">
  <img src="/ebook-figures/physiology/chapter-03-fen-27-0.23_0.27_0.83_0.906.webp" alt="Isotonic contraction" loading="lazy" width="1100" height="657" />
  <figcaption>Isotonic contraction: the muscle shortens and lifts a 20 kg load. Isometric contraction: it cannot lift a 30 kg load, so tension rises without shortening. <span class="figure-source">Slide 27, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

- **Isotonic contraction** (*iso* = same, *tonos* = tension): the muscle
  **changes length** while the tension stays about the same, because the
  force it develops is enough to move the load.
- **Isometric contraction** (*metron* = measure, length): the muscle
  develops tension but **does not change length**, because the load is
  too heavy to move (or the task is to hold a position).

In the classic experiment, a muscle is hung from a support with a weight
attached. With a 20 kg weight, the muscle develops 20 kg of tension,
shortens and lifts the weight: an isotonic contraction. With a 30 kg
weight that needs more than the muscle's maximal force (25 kg in the
example), tension rises to its maximum but the weight never leaves the
ground: an isometric contraction.

### Isotonic: concentric and eccentric

- **Concentric contraction:** the muscle **shortens** while generating
  force, for example the biceps when you lift a cup to your mouth.
- **Eccentric contraction:** the muscle **lengthens** while still
  generating force, because the load is greater than the force it
  exerts, for example the biceps as you lower the cup slowly, or the
  quadriceps when you walk downstairs. Eccentric work can produce the
  highest forces and causes most delayed-onset muscle soreness.

  <figcaption>Eccentric contraction (the muscle lengthens under load) and concentric contraction (the muscle shortens). <span class="figure-source">Slide 25, Fenomena Kontraksi &amp; Refleks Otot (Afifah &amp; Salsabrina)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

### Isometric

Examples are holding a heavy bag at your side, pushing against a wall,
or the postural muscles keeping the head upright. Every isotonic
contraction actually begins with a short isometric phase: tension must
first rise until it equals the load before any shortening can happen.
This is why, in PhysioEx, **heavier loads lengthen the latent period**
before the muscle starts to shorten.

### Load and velocity

The heavier the load, the longer the latent period, the **slower** the
shortening and the shorter the distance moved. When the load equals the
muscle's maximum force, shortening velocity falls to zero and the
contraction becomes isometric. With no load at all, velocity is at its
maximum. This **load–velocity relationship** is tested in PhysioEx
Activity 7 (Chapter 5).

## Key points

- Whole-muscle force depends on starting length, the number of motor
  units recruited and the frequency of stimulation.
- Active tension is maximal at the optimal length (sarcomere
  2.0–2.2 µm); passive tension from titin rises with stretch; total =
  active + passive.
- A motor unit is one motor neuron and all the fibers it supplies. More
  units = more force; recruitment follows the size principle.
- Twitch = response to one stimulus: latent period, contraction,
  relaxation.
- Treppe: stimuli after full relaxation, gradually rising twitches.
  Summation: stimuli before relaxation, peaks add up. Unfused tetanus:
  wavy plateau. Fused tetanus: smooth plateau at maximal tension.
- Fatigue is a fall in force despite continued stimulation; it can be
  central or peripheral, and it rises as glycogen falls.
- Isotonic = length changes (concentric shortening, eccentric
  lengthening); isometric = tension without length change. Heavier loads
  mean a longer latent period and slower shortening.
