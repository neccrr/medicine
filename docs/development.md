# Development

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neccrr/medicine.git
cd medicine
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173, guest-only
```

That's the whole app without accounts. `npm run dev:api` also serves the API
from the dev server with in-memory storage, so you can sign up, sync and use
the leaderboard locally. With `MONGODB_URI` set it uses that database instead
(a local MongoDB must run as a replica set, because Better Auth uses
transactions; a single node is fine, and Atlas always is).

Optional features work locally too, with their variables set in the shell or
`.env.local` (see [deploying](deploying.md)):

```bash
AI_BASE_URL=… AI_API_KEY=… AI_MODEL=… npm run dev:api
GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY=… GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=… npm run dev:api
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server on http://localhost:5173 (guest-only)
npm run dev:api      # same, plus the API with in-memory storage
npm run build        # type-check (tsc -b), build to dist/, then prerender
npm run preview      # serve the production build locally
npm run lint         # oxlint
npm run lint:css     # Stylelint
npm run test         # Vitest, single run
npm run test:watch   # Vitest, watch mode
npm run graph:relations   # AI labels for the knowledge map's links
npm run docs:wiki         # build the wiki pages into wiki-out/ (CI publishes them)
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"   # Markdown style
```

Before pushing, run the same checks CI would:

```bash
npx tsc -b && npm run lint && npm run lint:css && npm run test && npm run build
```

## Tests

Tests sit beside the code as `*.test.ts` and run in Node (no DOM). They cover:

- the pure logic in `src/lib`: SM-2, quiz scoring, shuffling and sections,
  exam format, readiness and today's plan, the muscle model and trace
  reading, image occlusion, the knowledge map, note matching, search
  indexing, text extraction, streaks, backup timing, tip of the day, the key
  registry and sync merging, the Class Drive helpers, help pages and route
  metadata;
- content integrity (`contentIntegrity.test.ts`) and the prerendered pages
  (`src/prerender/site.test.ts`, which also checks that no past-paper question
  is published);
- the API in `server/`: sign-up, sync, per-user isolation, validation, export
  and deletion, leaderboard scoring and ranking, the AI routes and allowance,
  and the Drive crawl and cache. `sync.e2e.test.ts` runs two browser sync
  engines against the real handler.

A test that needs `window` stubs it with `vi.stubGlobal`. The MongoDB stores
and indexes have an integration test against a real server, using a throwaway
database:

```bash
MONGODB_TEST_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0" npx vitest run server/mongo.integration.test.ts
```

There are no component tests; check UI changes in the browser, in light and
dark mode and at phone width (about 380 px).

## Conventions

- **Pure logic in `src/lib`, with a test.** Pages and hooks stay thin.
- **TypeScript is strict** with `erasableSyntaxOnly`: no enums, no
  namespaces, no constructor parameter properties.
- **Untrusted keys.** Ids from URLs, content or synced data never index plain
  objects directly. Use a `Map`, or the helpers in `src/lib/records.ts`
  (`own`, `setOwn`, `deleteOwn`, `entry`), and `itemAt` / `.at()` for arrays.
  A `/constructor` or `__proto__` in a URL or a sync must be just a string.
- **Storage** goes through `storageKey()` and the helpers in
  `src/lib/storage.ts`, never raw `localStorage` keys (see [storage and
  sync](storage-and-sync.md)).
- **CSS:** design tokens live in `src/styles/theme.css`; one stylesheet per
  area, imported by `src/index.css`. Colours use modern notation
  (`rgb(0 0 0 / 0.3)`), with alpha as a number. Every animation respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Markdown** wraps at 80 columns (tables exempt), with blank lines around
  lists. Bold terms stay on one line: the knowledge map reads them.
- **Comments** say why, not what.
- **Privacy:** no secrets in the repo (keys live in Vercel's environment
  variables), and no personal data in content. Anything only for signed-in
  students (the Class Drive) stays out of the prerendered pages, search and the
  knowledge map.

## Recipes

### A new page or section

1. Build the page in `src/pages/` and add a lazy import and a `<Route>` in
   `src/App.tsx`.
2. Add the section to `SECTIONS` in `src/lib/routeMeta.ts` (name, title,
   description, `indexable`), and its paths to `indexablePaths()`, or to
   `PRIVATE_PATHS` for a personal page.
3. Give it static content in `content()` in `src/prerender/site.ts` if it's
   indexable.
4. Add the section name to **both** section lists in `vercel.json`'s
   rewrites, so its prerendered pages are served.
5. Add it to the sidebar (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`) and to `staticPages`
   in `src/lib/searchIndex.ts`.
6. Add a help page for it in `content/help/` if students need one.

### A Virtual Lab activity

Activities are data in `src/lib/labActivities.ts`: slug, number, title,
summary, background, steps, expected result and check questions, plus a
`mode` that picks the bench (`twitch`, `voltage`, `frequency`, `tetanus`,
`fatigue`, `length`, `load`). A new mode needs its simulation in
`src/lib/muscleSim.ts` (with tests) and its controls and table columns in
`src/pages/LabActivity.tsx`. Routes, search, the sitemap and the prerendered
page follow from the list.

### A new kind of saved progress

See [storage and sync](storage-and-sync.md#adding-a-new-kind-of-progress).

### A new API route

Add it to the handler in `server/app.ts` (method check, session check,
validation with a readable error), give it a test in `server/app.test.ts`, and
document it in [the API reference](api.md). A new collection or index goes in
`server/schema.ts`.

### A new block

Add it to `studyBlocks` in `src/lib/blocks.ts` (with its `examDate` when it's
known), then add its content folders. See the [content guide](content-guide.md).

## Contributing

- **Content** (cards, questions, chapters, summaries, PDFs) never needs a code
  change: follow the [content guide](content-guide.md), including its privacy
  checklist.
- **Code:** run the checks above before opening a pull request.
- Open an issue first for changes to the data model (`src/types/content.ts`)
  or the content folder layout.
